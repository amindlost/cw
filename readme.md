# CAUSEWAY DOS EXTENDER

This repository contains the source code and binaries of Devore Software & Consulting's CauseWay DOS Extender v3.52, released 2000-01, for the purpose of archival and preservation.  As of 2022-01, the original web site is still available, but the pages containing the software are not; a mirror is available on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20191223143405/http://www.devoresoftware.com:80/freesource/mainsrc.htm).

Originally, the code was in a subdirectory under 'source/all'. Everything has been moved up one directory and the 'all' subdirectory has been removed. The 'source' directory has been renamed 'src'.

In addition to the binaries and source code, a copy of the CauseWay documentation in HTML format has been added to the 'doc' subdirectory.

Also, the source code for WarpLink v2.70 and WarpLink32 have been included under 'src/wl' and 'src/wl32', respectively.

There are archives of different releases available on the Internet, including v3.49 (as was originally listed on the Devore website), v3.60, and v4.01 Beta. The legitimacy of these archives, and the changes contained within, are unknown. Further, the source contained within the [Open Watcom V2](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2) repository has a version number of v4.05. As it the primary DOS extender used by the Open Watcom project, those wishing to contribute should look to the OWV2 project.

CauseWay, WarpLink, and WarpLink32 were released to the Public Domain between 1999-11 and 2000-01; and all copyrights were surrendered by Michael Devore.

## Overview

CauseWay is a 386 DOS extender package for use with Watcom C++ and assembly language programs. It consists of a DOS extender, provided as a stub EXE for Watcom C++ applications and bound to a protected mode linker for assembly language applications, as well as several support and enhancement utilities.

WarpLink and WarpLink 32 are linkers.

## License

As of January 9, 2000, Michael Devore surrendered all his copyrights for CauseWay for Watcom C/C++ & Assembly Language and released it to the public domain. Runtime libraries for CauseWay for Clipper 5, CauseWay for Clarion 2.1, and the trap file source for Watcom retain their separate third party copyrights or are covered by nondisclosure agreements and are not part of
the release of the CauseWay software to public domain.

There is no support or warranty whatsoever for the released files.  Under no conditions will Michael Devore be held liable for damages arising out of use of, or inability to use, the CauseWay files. You may send Devore Software & Consulting e-mail to freesource@devoresoftware.com with any questions, but those questions will, of necessity, have lower priority than paid customer/client inquiries and development works in progress. Such questions may be answered only after a long delay or not at all. But, depending on workload, the nature and framing of the request, and ineffable intangibles, it is within the realm of possibility that they will be answered immediately.  The small minority of individuals who may feel that they deserve priority
attention by calling, faxing, or sending questions to other e-mail addresses will probably be disappointed in the results, at best.

This is a true public domain release.  It is not Yet Another Open Source licensing arrangement.  You as an individual or as a business entity may use the binary and source files in whatever manner you desire, INCLUDING for commercial purposes, without explicit credit or compensation to Michael Devore or Devore Software & Consulting.  If you make a million off the code, toss a few thousand at a deserving charity.  Or don't, it's your choice.

And yes, this permission extends to any 386 DOS extender developer who has previously claimed the title "fastest" or "best" or "hot-damndest" (actually I've never heard that one) extender by virtue of a mix of carefully chosen benchmarks, feature sets, or chutzpah.  It even includes 286 DOS extender developers who may have enjoyed having their products grossly hyped to live a lifespan far past normal for their technical obsolescence.  If any vendor can use any of the released code here to help their customers or others, please have at it.
