<B><P>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</B> </P>
<P>CauseWay can make use of five environment variables. The assembly language protected mode linker, WL32, uses two environment variables when linking: OBJ and LIB. The DOS extender uses three at runtime: TEMP, TMP, and CAUSEWAY. Environment variables may be "burned-in" to the application EXE using the CauseWay WARPWRAP utility.</P>
<B><P>OBJ Environment Variable</P>
</B><P>The OBJ environment variable contains the name of one or more directories that are searched by the WL32 linker if WL32 does not find an object model in the current directory.</P>
<P>For example, assume your current directory is: C:\ASMWORK. The following commands like DISPLAY.OBJ and DRIVER.OBJ with SA.LIB:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=3><P>WL32 DISPLAY DRIVER,,,SA</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P>Without an OBJ environment variable, if DISPLAY.OBJ or DRIVER.OBJ are not in the C:\ASMWORK directory, WL32 issues a DOS error 2 (file not found) error. To specify that object modules may also be found in the \ASMWORK\SUPPORT directory on the current drive or the \HARDWARD directory on the F: drive, se the OJ environment variable as follows:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=3><P>SET OBJ=\ASMWORK\SUPPORT;F:\HARDWARE</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P>If DISPLAY.OBJ or DRIVER.OBJ are not found in the C:\ASMWORK directory, WL32 also searches the \ASMWORK\SUPPORT directory on the current drive and \HARDWARE directory on the F: drive for the object module files.</P>
<B><P>NOTE:</B> If an object module is explicitly given a path specification in the link file or command line, the WL32 will only search for the file in the path specified. The OBJ environment variable directories are searched for a file only when a file is listed without an associated directory and WL32 does not find the file in the current directory.</P>
