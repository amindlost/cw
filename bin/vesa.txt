VESA INT 10h
============

CauseWay does not have built-in support for VESA functions due
to the majority of programs not requiring VESA support. Keeping
VESA support as an external patch avoids unnecessary increases
in the size of CauseWay for those that do not need extra
functions.

The VESA module supplied for use with Watcom C/C++ should be
included in your link command to enable VESA function support.
Simply add the file "vesa.obj" to your list of object modules
when linking.

The VESA module will be initialized and removed automatically by
the Watcom startup/cleanup code so no manual calls are required.

Once installed you may issue VESA function requests with
protected mode buffer pointers where appropriate. Note that any
returned buffer parameters that are defined in the VESA
documentation as seg:offset (16:16) pointers are automatically
converted to DGROUP relative 32-bit pointers that can be
accessed in the normal manner. No translation of these addresses
is required to use them.
